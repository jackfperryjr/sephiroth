Sephiroth
=========

This application comes with three users in the database and they all use the same password.

## Users:

* admin@example.com
* manager@example.com
* test@example.com

 Admin has complete control over modifying, approving, or rejecting the requests.<br/>
 Manager can see all of the requests and can approve or reject them.<br/>
 Test can only see the approved requests, their own requests, and can modify their pending requests.<br/>

Built with VSCode, .NET Core, and a SQLite database.

(I misspelled "refactored" in a commit!)
