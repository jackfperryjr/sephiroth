            Sephiroth (セフィロス, Sefirosu) is a fictional character in the role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII developed by Square (now Square Enix), where he is the main villain. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura conceived and designed Sephiroth as an antagonist to and direct physical opposite of the game's main character, Cloud Strife. The character was voiced in Japanese by voice actor Toshiyuki Morikawa and in English by both Lance Bass in Kingdom Hearts and George Newbern in all his subsequent appearances.

           So, basically, you have to register an account first. You'll enter your name, email, and create a password. Then, you'll be emailed a confirmation link to finish registering; now you can login! After login, go to Requests and you'll be able to view all of the requests you've made and whether they've been approved or rejected. In Requests you can submit a new request and upon doing so you'll receive an email notification of your request with your request details. Once reviewed by the admin, in this case Sephiroth, another email notification will be sent letting you know if the request has been approved or rejected.
